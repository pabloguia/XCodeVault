# Compatibility Matrix

Evidence ledger, not a table of boolean claims. One entry per (macOS version/build,
Xcode version/build, architecture, storage-category strategy) combination actually
tested. Do not list untested combinations as if they were verified — omit them, or
list as "pending."

Scope is bounded by ADR-0001 (minimum macOS 14). Do not spend testing capacity below
that floor, and do not invent impossible OS/Xcode pairs.

Combinations to prioritize:

| Priority | macOS | Xcode | Arch | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | 26 (current) | 26.x | Apple Silicon | Where nearly all active developers are; CI runner `macos-26` exists |
| P0 | 15.6+ | 26.x | Apple Silicon | Minimum combination that can still ship to the App Store; CI runner `macos-15` exists |
| P1 | 15.6+ | 26.x | Intel | Last Intel-capable generation; different APFS/mount behavior is plausible |
| P1 | 14.5+ | 16.x | Apple Silicon | The declared floor — must be exercised at least manually; no CI runner after 2026-11-02 |
| P2 | 27 (when released) | 27.x betas | Apple Silicon | Forward-looking regression watch |

Anything below macOS 14 is **out of scope** — pre-14 users get, at most, the read-only
diagnostic mode (ADR-0001), which needs no matrix entry beyond "reports only, changes
nothing."

Because `macos-13` runners are gone and `macos-14` goes fully unsupported 2026-11-02,
the macOS 14 row is **manual-only** from November 2026. Mark those entries
"pending — manual" until someone runs them on real hardware and records the output.

## Entry template

```
### <category/strategy> — macOS <version/build> · Xcode <version/build> · <arch>

- Date tested:
- Hypothesis reference: H#
- Test performed: (scan / relocate / mount / functional probe / crash-inject / ...)
- Result: pass / fail / partial
- Evidence: (log excerpt, command output, or link to test artifact in repo)
- Functional checks: simulator boot / xcodebuild / physical device (mark N/A if not applicable)
- Verdict: verified / probable / falsified / experimental
- Notes:
```

## CI vs. manual

For combinations that cannot run in CI (old macOS/Xcode, physical hardware),
maintain an explicit manual test protocol document alongside this matrix and mark
those entries "pending — manual" until someone actually runs and records the result.
