# Compatibility Matrix

Evidence ledger, not a table of boolean claims. One entry per (macOS version/build,
Xcode version/build, architecture, storage-category strategy) combination actually
tested. Do not list untested combinations as if they were verified — omit them, or
list as "pending."

Representative generations to prioritize (adjust as real testing capacity dictates —
don't invent impossible OS/Xcode pairs): older Intel-era macOS/Xcode, Xcode 12,
Xcode 14, Xcode 15, Xcode 16, Xcode 26, and current betas when practical. Cover both
Intel and Apple Silicon where the OS/Xcode combination supports both.

## Entry template

```
### <category/strategy> — macOS <version/build> · Xcode <version/build> · <arch>

- Date tested:
- Hypothesis reference: H#
- Test performed: (scan / relocate / mount / functional probe / crash-inject / ...)
- Result: pass / fail / partial
- Evidence: (log excerpt, command output, or link to test artifact in repo)
- Functional checks: simulator boot / xcodebuild / physical device (mark N/A if not applicable)
- Verdict: verified / probable / falsified / experimental
- Notes:
```

## CI vs. manual

For combinations that cannot run in CI (old macOS/Xcode, physical hardware),
maintain an explicit manual test protocol document alongside this matrix and mark
those entries "pending — manual" until someone actually runs and records the result.
